        <option value="go on the old plan, please" />
        <option value="what is according to the plan?" />
        <option value="you have scaned the project and told me what can be improved" />
        <option value="move forward, please" />
        <option value="it seems you broke my movement. I fixed it but be careful. I need ai movement to the minions. I have written some functions about this but they are not working. check them and try to implement the moving of the minions " />
        <option value="start coding, please " />
        <option value="i do not want to make you sad but this is not working at all " />
        <option value="yes, I am OK " />
        <option value="ok. let's focus on the buttons. Backpack is not working for some reason, give sais it is invalid command and battle is not finding properly if there is a minion on the field. Any suggestions here?" />
        <option value="why player id but treasure not found? battle command still not working properly and the backpack one not tested yet. " />
        <option value="all at once. no error messages received " />
        <option value="try solving the issues " />
        <option value="whole plan " />

The other thinga are not fixed as well " />
        <option value="try fixing the backpack command for start, please" />
        <option value="yes, it sounds perfect" />
        <option value="small change, make every text typing not key sensitive" />
        <option value="yes, implement the change, please" />
        <option value="i think it is better than before but in the backpack window whenever I press which of the three buttons, there is a messaga that says me the command is invalid. Investigate adn fix this " />
        <option value="go ahead, please" />
        <option value="thanks. backpack command is fixed. Let's fix the give command. It is confusing that it wants a player id but responds with treasure not found" />
        <option value="go ahead" />
        <option value="give command works perfectly. one more little anoying change. Make every message to appear on a new line, please. I can do it myself but the problem is it is too annoying and you can automate this process in seconds " />
        <option value="you here?" />
        <option value="give command works perfectly. one more little anoying change. Make every message to appear on a new line, please. I can do it myself but the problem is it is too annoying and you can automate this process in seconds" />
        <option value="yes, proceed, please" />
        <option value="I know this is really hard task but try to help me fix the battle command. It is not working propertly. When my hero is on a field with a minion on it, instead, of fighting, the command says there is no player, which means the statement that there is a minion returned false (even if there is a minion on that field)" />
        <option value="yes, dive deeper" />
        <option value="why messages are printed twice? fix this. also, the battle button is working only on fields with minions on them (which is great) but instead of beating with them, it check for other players. fix this as well " />
        <option value="yes" />
        <option value="please, check the battle command. it is not working at all. try do debug it, please " />
        <option value="just do it" />
        <option value="why if there is a minion on a position, the battle command cannot find it? Investigate it carefully and gelp me fix the issue " />
        <option value="just do it" />
        <option value="only with yes or no, do I handle game over?" />
        <option value="yes" />
        <option value="I do not get it. I made a change in the logic for checking if there is a minion on the current position. but it seems in the battle command, getMinionAtPosition cannot find the minion, eventhough it is at the same position as the hero " />
        <option value="go ahead" />
        <option value="I want battle results to be printed on the event handler on the GUI " />
        <option value="go ahead" />
        <option value="only yes or no, do you think the project is ready for deployment?" />
        <option value="check then" />
